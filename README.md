# Probabilistic Restaurant Search Engine

[This](https://xgboost.netlify.app) is a search engine that Oliver Melgrove wrote for the final project of Statistics 101C taught by Shirong Xu at UCLA. It uses a dataset of Yelp reviews from Santa Barbara to make a prediction of what restaurants someone would like to see given a search query. The reviews have been encoded using GloVe pre-trained twitter embeddings, and the model has been trained using XGBoost.
